<ol>
  <li><h4>Java languaje is compiled or interpreted?</h4></li>
  <ul><li> R: Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. 
    This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter</li></ul>
  <li><h4> Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Find the conversion rate of the local currency</li>
      <li>Divide the local currency by the amount that you want</li>
      <li>Calculate how much money you will have after the change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Why is pseudocode helpful?</h4></li>
  <ul><li> R: Pseudocode is usefull to getting started with software programming because you can learn the logic without the strict syntax rules and its easy to understand with other people</li></ul>
  <li><h4>Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born</h4></li>
  <ul><li>Y: 2022;</li>
    <li>Year_birth: input;</li>
    <li>OP: Y-Year_birth;</li>
    <li>Age: OP;</li>
  </ul>
  <li><h4>Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?</h4>
    <ul><li> With flowcharts we can determine the operation of a project and better define its development</li>
