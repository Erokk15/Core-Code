Core Code bootcamp

# First day activity

  ### 1. Java languaje is compiled or interpreted?
  - R: Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. 
    This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter
    
  ### 2. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
  - Find the conversion rate of the local currency
  - Divide the local currency by the amount that you want
  - Calculate how much money you will have after the change
 
  ### 3. Why is pseudocode helpful?
  - R: Pseudocode is usefull to getting started with software programming because you can learn the logic without the strict syntax rules and its easy to understand with other people
 
  ### 4. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born
   - Start
   - Y: 2022; --- *a単o actual*
   - Year_birth: input; --- *solicitamos el a単o de nacimiento del usuario*
   - Age: Y-Year_birth; --- *restamos el a単o actual con el a単o de nacimiento del usuario*
   - print(Age); --- *Mostramos en pantalla la edad del usuario*
   - End
  ### Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
   - R: With flowcharts we can determine the operation of a project and better define its development

# Second day activity
  ### 1. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
   - Decimal: 2001
   - Hexadecimal: 7D1
   - Binary: 11111010001
 
  ### 2. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary
   - Hexadecimal: CAFE
   - Binary: 1100101011111110
  
  ### 3. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language:
   3.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user<br></ol>
